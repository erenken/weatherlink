# myNOC.WeatherLink

## Overview

A library for communicating with the [WeatherLink v2 API](https://weatherlink.github.io/v2-api/).

This library is initially built for my needs as I am building a new Weather Website form my station, and in the process I thought this library may be usefull to more people.

This is still in very early release and I will be expanding it.
